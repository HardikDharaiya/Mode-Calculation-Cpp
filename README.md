# Mode Calculation in C++ (Semester 3 Project)

This project calculates the **Mode (Z)** from grouped frequency distribution using C++. It was developed as part of the Semester 3 C++ coursework at RK University.

## 📘 Project Overview

- `Mode(C++)_Explanation.pdf` – Documentation with logic and screenshot

Given class intervals and their corresponding frequencies, this program:
- Builds and displays an X-Y table
- Identifies the modal class
- Applies the Mode formula:
  Z = l + [(f1 - f0) / (2f1 - f0 - f2)] × h
- Outputs the Mode value

## 🛠️ Skills Used
- C++ arrays and loops
- Logic implementation of statistical formulas
- Formatted input/output
